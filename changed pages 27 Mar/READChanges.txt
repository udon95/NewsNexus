I changed appearance of things, added write article features and able to close dropdown by clicking anywhere outside


In order to have write article features, i added the following install to client node modules.
Can see it in package lock json.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/starter-kit @tiptap/extension-link @tiptap/extension-underline

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Things like the draft expiry extension, i think better to do after connect backend
